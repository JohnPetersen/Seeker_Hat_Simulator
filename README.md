This is a quick and dirty simulator created so that I could visualize and test the [Seeker Hat](https://github.com/JohnPetersen/Seeker_Hats) hardware/software without having to build a second unit during development.

It is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and requires an xBee connection to the unit under test.
